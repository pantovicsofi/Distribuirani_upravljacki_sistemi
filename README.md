# Distributed Control Systems
:mortar_board:

## *Course content*

* Introduction to distributed control systems - DSC - definitions, characteristics, architecture

* Communication subsystem - function, communication networks, protocols, realization

* DSC in the automation of processes and plants - hierarchical levels, data bases, DCS realization, human machine interface, supervisory control and data acquisition systems-SCADA

* Communications in industry and characteristics of industrial communication networks

* Operation of DCS in real time

* Closed loop control over communication network

* Open DCS and subsystem integration

## *Educational goals and outcomes*


* Knowledge, skills and abilities necessary for an understanding of complexity of distributed systems, with emphasis on automatic control systems, real-time systems and critical infrastructural systems.

* Students will learn the paradigms and principles of such systems and they will be able to solve engineering problems, use existing distributed systems, as well as to participate in the development of new applications for distributed systems.
